(4)  What is the difference between code-first approach and database approach in Entity framework?
ANS- In the code-first approach, we first create all entity classes with all of its properties.
     When we run the code, the Entity framework will create the database and all the tables based on 
     the entity classes we have defined using migration.So the database is generated from the code.

     Where as In the database approach,We first create the database and all the tables.Then we add the 
     entity framework data model using the database that we have created.


(5)  What is the MVVM design pattern?
ANS- The MVVM design pattern has three main parts:model,view and viewmodel
     (1) Model contains all the model classes,data access and rules.
     (2) View is a user interface which is XAML code.
     (3) ViewModel kinds of interface between view and model.It provides data binding between View and 
         model.
